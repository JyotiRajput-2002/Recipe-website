    <h1>Chocolate Cake Recipe</h1>
    <center><div class="image"></div></center>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Cake</h3>
    <p>225g/8oz plain flour<br>
        350g/12½oz caster sugar<br>
        85g/3oz cocoa powder<br>
        1½ tsp baking powder<br>
        1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda<br>
        2 free-range eggs<br>
        250ml/9fl oz milk<br>
        125ml/4½fl oz vegetable oil<br>
        2 tsp vanilla extract<br>
        250ml/9fl oz boiling water<br><br>
    <h4>Recipe Method</h4>
    <p>1. Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease and line two 20cm/8in sandwich tins.
          <br><br>
       2. For the cake, place all of the cake ingredients, except the boiling water, into a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon, or electric whisk, beat the mixture until smooth and well combined.
        <br><br>
       3. Add the boiling water to the mixture, a little at a time, until smooth. (The cake mixture will now be very liquid.)
       <br><br>
       4. Divide the cake batter between the sandwich tins and bake in the oven for 25-35 minutes, or until the top is firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
       <br><br>
       5. Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool completely, still in their tins, before icing.
       <br><br>
       6. For the chocolate icing, heat the chocolate and cream in a saucepan over a low heat until the chocolate melts. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk the mixture until smooth, glossy and <br>thickened. Set aside to cool for 1-2 hours, or until thick enough to spread over the cake.
       <br><br>
       7. To assemble the cake, run a round-bladed knife around the inside of the cake tins to loosen the cakes. Carefully remove the cakes from the tins.
       <br><br>
       8. Spread a little chocolate icing over the top of one of the chocolate cakes, then carefully top with the other cake.
       <br><br>
       9. Transfer the cake to a serving plate and ice the cake all over with the chocolate icing, using a palette knife.

            <h2>Recipe Tips</h2>
            <p>* The chocolate cake mixture is quite thin, so it's important to use sandwich tins rather than springform tins, which could leak.
                <br><br>
               * You don't have to cover the cake in ganache, you can also use buttercream.</p>
