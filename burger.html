    <h1>Burger Recipe</h1>
    <center><div class="image"></div></center>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Burger</h3>
    <p>2 lbs ground beef<br>
        4-8 burger buns<br>
        8 slices American cheese<br>
        lettuce (iceberg, romaine etc)<br>
        1-2 tomato sliced<br>
        1 1/2 tbsp garlic powder<br>
        1 tbsp smoked paprika<br>
        1/2 tbsp black pepper<br>
        1/2 tsp salt<br>
        2-2 1/2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce<br>
        mayo<br>
        mustard<br>
        ketchup<br>
        vegetable oil if cooking on stove top</p><br><br>
    <h4>Recipe Method</h4>
    <p>1. Letâ€™s make some homemade burgers! And discover how EASY it is to make it happen!
         <br><br>
       2. To get started, fire up your grill. Next, bring 2 lbs of defrosted ground beef into a large mixing bowl, and using your hands or a spatula, sightly loosen the ground beef.
        <br><br>
       3. For the burger seasoning, mix the dry ingredients together in a small ramekin, consisting of smoked paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, and salt.
       The goal is to enhance the taste of the ground beef with some spices, but not overpower it, because we want to be able to taste the meat. It is, after, a MEAT burger ðŸ˜‰
         <br><br>
       4. Pour half of the mixed dry ingredients into the ground beef, use your hand to mix it into the beef, then pour the other half in and do the same.
       <br><br>
       5. Next, pour about 2 1/2 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce into the ground beef. Use less Worcestershire if ground beef has a higher fat content.
       <br><br>
       6. We use 2 1/2 tbsp for 93% lean 7% fat ground beef. If you are using 80% lean 20% fat ground beef, decrease your Worcestershire content to 2 tbsp.
       Use hand to mix everything up, making sure you mix thoroughly. Worcestershire binds the meat together.
       <br><br>
       7. Next make the burger patties by grabbing about a fistful of ground beef and flattening it into 4-inch wide diameter and 1-inch thick patties.
       <br><br>
       8. Round the sides and gently press down on the middle of the patty to form a slight indention in the middle, because when the burgers cook the middle of the circle tend to rise more than the sides.
       If you are using a skillet, grease skillet with oil and turn on the heat.
        <br><br>
       9. Place patties on grill/skillet, and cook on one side, then flip to cook the other side after a few minutes.
       <br><br>
       10. As a reference point, our grill was at 300â„‰ the whole time, and we cooked for 6 1/2 minutes on each side and got medium-well burgers.
       Juicy, tasty, perfectly charred ground beef patties. My tummy is hungry!
        <br><br>
        11. Place a slice of cheese on the patties the last 30 seconds or so before removing from heat.</p><br>
